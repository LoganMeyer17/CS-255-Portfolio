**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass project was designed for a client who wanted an online system to help students get ready for their DMV driving tests. The idea was to make studying and scheduling lessons easier by combining everything in one place. Students could sign up, take practice tests, track their progress, and book in-person driving lessons. Instructors and administrators would use the same system to manage schedules, lesson details, and test content. The goal was to create something that made learning more convenient while improving student pass rates.

**What did you do particularly well?**

One thing I’m proud of is how clearly I captured what the client needed and turned those ideas into detailed requirements. I made sure that every feature connected to a real goal, like improving accessibility or keeping data secure. I also think I did a strong job organizing the technical design in a way that would make the system reliable and easy to maintain. My documents explain not only what the system should do but also how each part supports the overall purpose.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
If I were to go back and improve one part, I’d focus on the UML diagrams. They already show the main flow of the system, but I’d like to add more about how users and components interact behind the scenes. For example, showing what happens when something goes wrong or how the system recovers from an error would make it feel more complete. Little improvements like that can make a big difference when it comes time to actually build the software.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Understanding what the user really wants is where good design starts. I spent time reviewing the client interview and picking out the most important points, like scheduling flexibility, progress tracking, and keeping DMV content current. Once I understood those needs, I made sure they guided every decision in the design. Thinking about users first is essential because it keeps the project grounded. It’s easy to get caught up in the technical side, but if the system doesn’t actually solve the user’s problems, then it’s not doing its job.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
When I design software, I like to start simple and build from there. I take time to understand the problem, sketch out ideas, and then use diagrams to connect everything together. I believe in designing iteratively, getting feedback early, and improving as I go. Clear communication, both in diagrams and in writing, is something I value a lot because it helps everyone stay on the same page. In the future, I plan to keep using this structured yet flexible approach to build systems that are both functional and user-friendly.
